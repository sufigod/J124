Add an image of yourself (like a headshot) or an image that represents you/something you like to do).

Create an <h2> header and call it “Skills.” Add an ordered list underneath with three professional skills you have (i.e. software programs, languages, etc.)

**EXTRA CREDIT** Create a table of 3 jobs/internships you have had (you can include more if you want to). The left column should be the place of employment; label the header “Employer.” The right column should be a few lines about what you did; label the column header “Job Description.”  Write 2-3 things you did in the right column for each job as an unordered list with bullet points.
